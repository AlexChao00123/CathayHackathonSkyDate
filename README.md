Technology and Future Development
SkyTravel was developed using the Power Pages no-code platform, which provided a user-friendly Content Management System for effortless trip management. CoPilot, our advanced AI technology, played a vital role in offering intelligent suggestions and enhancing the user experience. The integration of an AI chatbot streamlined customer support, ensuring a smooth journey for users. Our commitment to innovation means we continuously explore new technologies. CoPilot and ChatGPT, powered by cutting-edge AI capabilities, were utilized to build the app.

In the future, we plan to integrate the Cathay Membership program, allowing users to earn or redeem Asian miles within the app. This integration will provide additional value and rewards, further enhancing the travel experience for our users.
