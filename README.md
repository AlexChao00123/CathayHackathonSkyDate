## Target Audience
While SkyTravel caters to various types of users, it particularly targets high-value customers of Cathay who prioritize traveling with a lifestyle. It helps build a sense of belongingness within the Cathay ecosystem and offers a wide range of functions and benefits that attract customers' attention. By collaborating with Cathay's business partners, the app promotes the Cathay brand and expands the Cathay Group's business into accommodation, brand retailing, and luxurious experiences. This cross-selling approach increases revenue opportunities beyond air travel.

## Technology Stack
To create SkyTravel, we harnessed the power of a no-code platform called Power Pages and integrated CoPilot technology. Power Pages served as a Content Management System, providing users with effortless trip management and a user-friendly interface to create personalized tours. CoPilot, powered by generative AI, played a crucial role by offering intelligent suggestions and ideas to enhance the user experience and ensure a seamless journey planning process. We also leveraged the Power Platform for integrating an AI chatbot, simplifying the user experience and providing efficient customer support. Throughout the development process, we incorporated cutting-edge technologies, including CoPilot and ChatGPT, to harness the capabilities of advanced AI.

## Future Development
Looking ahead, we have exciting plans for further development. One of our key objectives is to integrate with the Cathay Membership program, allowing users to earn or deduct Asia Miles within our app. This integration will add value and rewards to users' travel experiences, encouraging long-term usage and fostering customer loyalty with Cathay.

SkyTravel is designed to offer a seamless, personalized, and technologically advanced platform for users to create and enjoy their unique travel experiences. Join us today and embark on unforgettable journeys with like-minded travelers!
